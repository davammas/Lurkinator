# Lurkinator

UPDATE:

Lurkinator is now stronger as web-based app: http://www.lurkinator.net

The "Lurkinator" program is a MultiTwtich-like system I made for streamers to connect and grow. We will launch a new Stream Team and software for members soon!

See the most updated info, how it works, faq, and instructions on the FAQ webpage: http://www.psynapticmedia.com/twitch-stream-lurkinator/

How to Lurk:
- Visit http://www.lurkinator.net or Download and Run the Lurkinator exe.
- Enter your Twitch name in the app (if you are a streamer and want to be on the community streamer list).
- Enter a few streamers you want to watch (optional, you don't need to).
- Press the "Start" button.
- Your browser will open a multi-Twitch style layout playing your favorite streamers along with the Lurk community streamers.

How to Grow your Stream
- Add your Twitch name to the text box before you launch Lurkinator. This will put you on the community streamer list.
- Run the app as much as possible. The longer you watch, the longer you will be watched when you are live.
- Use it on your main computer or use it on any computer(s).
- You don't have to run it while you are live (unless you want to), as long as you are using it during other times to accumulate points!
- If you have questions or feature requests, please ask.

How to Support your Favorite Streamer
- Add your favorite streamer(s) to the text box before you launch Lurkinator.
- Run the app as much as possible. The longer you watch, the more you are supporting your favorite streamer(s), and you wont miss it when they go ilve..
- Use it on your main computer or use it on any computer(s).
- If you have questions or feature requests, please ask.

You also get points as you watch (using the app). This tracks the people who are watching, so each person who is watching and gathering points will remain on the Lurk community list. The result is those who are using Lurkinator regularly, get played on Lurkinator when they go live. If you don’t use the app regularly, you will fall off the list eventually.

More details soon, if you have questions just ask! If you have feature requests, please request.
